    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A rich lemon sauce for chicken makes this dish perfect for a special meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons capers, drained</li>
        <li>2 lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together flour and salt in a medium dish or resealable plastic bag. Coat chicken in flour mixture; shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate; cover and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Pour white wine into the skillet; allow to boil while scraping the cooked bits from the bottom of the pan. Add lemon juice; boil until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cubed butter into boiling sauce. Swirl and shake the pan vigorously until butter is completely incorporated and sauce thickens. (Butter must never come to rest, or sauce will separate and become oily.) Remove from heat and stir in capers.</li>
        <li>Pour lemon-caper sauce over chicken; serve with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
